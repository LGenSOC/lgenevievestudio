This project has 3 objectives:
Get a custom domain name to host your portfolio page
Create a pipeline that (as a minimum) facilitates Continuous Delivery (CD) from the main branch of your repo, connected to your and have a placeholder page deployed with a first commit
Plan and wireframe an initial prototype for your portfolio, ready to get some quick feedback from others
You won't finish your portfolio or plan today, and if you have something existing then use that as your starting point but go through the design and feedback process.

The point of this hackathon is not to make a beautiful site - it's to get the automated deployment working and to configure a custom domain, and start the journey of design and feedback.
Main points:
Have a single page portfolio site that can be accessed on the internet.
Use your Github Student pack to claim a free custom domain that you'd like to use for your portfolio.
Configure the custom domain to point to a deployed website.
Have a build > deploy pipeline configured so that when you commit / merge a branch into main on Github it triggers a build and deployment of the new version of your site.
Advice:
The whole point of the task is to make sure you can keep making small updates/changes to your site and each time you commit/merge to main it deploys. CI/CD feels amazing and we want you to get that in place.

Your Github student pack includes some providers that offer you a free domain. Go to one of those sites and claim/choose your domain.

Then decide where you would like to deploy your site - you can choose anywhere, GitHub pages, Netlify, AWS, anywhere... The decision is yours!
Demos
In the afternoon, we'll be splitting into focus groups for initial demos and feedback from peers on your work so far, and practice explaining your pipeline.
